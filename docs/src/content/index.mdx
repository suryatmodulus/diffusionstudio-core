# Introduction

Diffusion Studio Core is a browser based video engine built in TypeScript for fast media composition. Think of it like a game engine that is optimized for video, audio and image workloads. 

It supports both interactive playback for editing and a high fidelity rendering mode for final output. Developers often use it to build non linear editors or other timeline based media applications (e.g. [Diffusion Studio Pro](https://pro.diffusion.studio)).

Under the hood it takes advantage of Canvas2DContext and the WebCodecs API to tap directly into hardware accelerated processing in the browser.

## Installation  

```bash
npm install @diffusionstudio/core
```

## Usage  

The engine is commonly used in the following way:
```ts
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const composition = new core.Composition();
```
