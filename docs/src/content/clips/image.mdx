# Image Clip

The `ImageClip` class, like all static clips (excluding Video, Audio and Caption), has a fixed start and stop time.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const url = 'https://diffusion-studio-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/lenna.png';
const source = await core.Source.from<core.ImageSource>(url);
const image = new core.ImageClip(source, { delay: 20, duration: 100 });
```

You can place an `ImageClip` on the timeline by setting its `delay` and `duration` properties.

## Moving the Clip along the Timeline

Using `delay`:

```typescript
image.delay = 0;
```

Alternatively, you can achieve the same result using the `trim` method:

```typescript
image.trim(0, 100);
```

Which sets the clip's delay to `0` and its duration to `100` (seconds).

## Splitting Clips

You can split an `ImageClip` into two clips (when added to a layer) at a specified time:

```typescript
const layer = await composition.add(new core.Layer());
await layer.add(image);

const imageNew = image.split(50);
```

This will split the clip at 50 seconds.
