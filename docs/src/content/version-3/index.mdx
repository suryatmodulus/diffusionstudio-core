# Introduction

**Core** is a TypeScript library for programmatic video editing using WebCodecs. It runs entirely in the browser and supports headless editing, making it ideal for automating video processing tasks.  

For server-side usage, you can integrate **Core** with **Playwright** or **Puppeteer**. While using a browser for video rendering in a server environment may seem unconventional, Chromium is one of the most sophisticated rendering engines available, making it a powerful choice for this purpose.  

## Installation  

```bash
npm install @diffusionstudio/core
```

## Usage  

The engine is commonly used in the following way:
```ts
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const composition = new core.Composition();
```
