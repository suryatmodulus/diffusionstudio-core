# Terminology

To better understand the documentation, here are some key terms you should know:

- **Asset:** A serializable object containing the location and mime type of a file.
- **Source:** A class that prepares an asset for rendering, it will cache data and can be used to share resources between multiple clips.
- **Composition:** The root object that contains all objects to be rendered in a single video.
- **Layer:** A chronological sequence of clips of the same type (e.g., video clips).
- **Clip:** An object that contains specific rendering information, such as position and duration of visibility within the video.
- **Framerate:** The rate at which frames are displayed, measured in frames per second (FPS). If not specified otherwise, Diffusion Studio uses a default frame rate of 30 FPS.
- **Encoder:** A tool that compresses the size of each frame within the sequence, using common codecs such as H.264/AVC1 or H.265/HEVC.

## Time Units
When working with time units, you can use the following formats:

- `2` (seconds), `2ms`, `2s`, `2f` (frames), `3.5min`, `2:35` (MM:SS), `4:32:12` (HH:MM:SS)

## Steps to Render a Video

1. Create a `Composition`
2. Load an asset using a `Source`
3. Add a `Layer` to the composition
4. Create a `Clip` using the `Source`
5. Add the `Clip` to the `Layer`
6. Create an `Encoder` using the `Composition`
7. Render to a file or stream

That's enough theoretical background. Now lets start hacking!
